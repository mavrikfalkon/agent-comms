/**
 * MeshTransport — abstract transport layer for the peer mesh.
 *
 * The transport owns connections (TCP sockets, TLS sockets, WebSockets)
 * and provides send/receive primitives. MeshStore handles state management
 * and delegates all I/O to the transport.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. startDataServer() — listen for incoming peer data connections
 *   2. connectToCoordinator() — join an existing mesh
 *      OR becomeCoordinator() — start a new mesh as coordinator
 *   3. connectToPeer() — establish data connection to a discovered peer
 *   4. send() / broadcast() — send wire messages
 *   5. shutdown() — close all connections and servers
 *
 * The transport emits received messages via the onMessage callback.
 * It does not interpret messages — that's MeshStore's job.
